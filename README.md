# How to use project
## Features
### Create a habit
#### How it works
A user can click/tap the 'Create new habit' button to open a modal with the following fields:
- Habit title (?)
- Daily limit

Once the habit is created they will see it in their list of habits. Habits are displayed in order of creation - most recent to least recent

### Delete a habit
#### How it works
Currently a user can only delete an entire habit - future improvement - archive habit data but no longer show?

### Edit a habit
#### How it works

### Update count for a habit
#### How it works
Each habit box is clickable, when a user clicks or taps on the plus symbol they are able to increase the count for that habit.</br>
Once a habit's daily count has been reached, the button is disabled and the user is no longer able to increase the count for that day unless the limit is increased.

### Local Storage
### Sharing habit log
### Retaining archived habit details (?)
### Stats? i.e. can we pull these from habit log
